# EthWalletRN

- This app generates and displays a valid Ethereum address that can be used to store any digital asset on the Ethereum network. It will also display its associated private key.

- The address and private key generated is different for each unique device the app runs on.

- Lighting up the app multiple times on the same device must generate the same address and private key every time. 

## Quickstart:
```
In project root directory:

npm install
react-native run-ios

```
